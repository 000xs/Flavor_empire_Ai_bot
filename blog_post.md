## Ingredients
- ½ cup rolled oats (not instant)
- ½ cup milk of your choice (dairy, almond, coconut, or oat milk work well)
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup or honey (adjust to taste)
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- Optional mix-ins:
  - 1 tablespoon cocoa powder for chocolate flavor
  - ½ mashed banana for extra creaminess
  - ¼ cup fresh berries or sliced fruit
  - 1 tablespoon nut butter
  - 1 tablespoon shredded coconut

  - Sprinkle of cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice

## Instructions
1. In a mason jar or airtight container, combine the rolled oats, chia seeds, salt, and any dry flavorings like cocoa powder or cinnamon.
2. Add your milk of choice, maple syrup (or honey), and vanilla extract.
3. Stir everything together thoroughly until well combined and there are no dry clumps.
4. If using fresh fruit, mash it slightly before adding to the oats, or add it in the morning to maintain texture.
5. Seal the container with a lid and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.
6. In the morning, give the oats a good stir. If the mixture is too thick, add a splash more milk until you reach your desired consistency.
7. Top with your favorite mix-ins like fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, or a drizzle of nut butter.
8. Enjoy immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

## Tips
- For extra creaminess, try using half milk and half Greek yogurt or cottage cheese in your overnight oats.
- Layer your oats in a jar with different ingredients for a beautiful parfait effect – start with oats at the bottom, add fruit or nut butter in the middle, and finish with more oats on top.
- Make a batch at the beginning of the week to have grab-and-go breakfasts ready all week long!
